# Performance

The site must load fast. Follow the practices below.

## Assets and network

- **Images**: Use local photo `layouts/IMG_2003.jpg` (or copy to `public/` or assets); optimize (modern format, appropriate dimensions, lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` when off-viewport).
- **Fonts**: Prefer `font-display: swap`; subset or self-host if it reduces external requests.
- **Scripts/CSS**: Production build with bundling, minification, and tree-shaking; avoid CDN runtime in prod if the bundle already includes it (e.g. built Tailwind).

## Rendering

- **Critical path**: Critical CSS inline or loaded first; avoid render blocking by unnecessary JS at the top.
- **Vue**: Lazy-load routes (`() => import('./views/...')`); heavy components loaded on demand when possible.
- **Hydration**: With SSR/SSG, keep payload minimal; above-the-fold components first.

## General best practices

- Do not load large libs for small tasks; prefer native APIs when sufficient.
- Measure: Use Lighthouse (Performance, LCP, FID, CLS) and keep metrics acceptable.
- Cache: Appropriate static cache headers in Express for versioned assets (hash in filename).
