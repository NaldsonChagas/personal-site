# Responsive Development

When developing any new feature:

- **Analyze both layouts**: Check `layouts/desktop/code.html` and `layouts/mobile/code.html` (and their PNGs) to understand structure, breakpoints, and behavior on each viewport.
- **Design mobile-first or parity**: Ensure the feature works and looks correct on small and large screens; use Tailwind breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.) consistently.
- **Test viewports**: Verify behavior at key widths (e.g. 320px, 768px, 1024px); avoid layout breaks or overflow.
- **Touch and interaction**: On mobile, touch targets and navigation (e.g. hamburger menu) must match the reference; avoid hover-only interactions for critical UI.

Responsiveness is a requirement for every UI change, not an afterthought.
