# Code Clarity

## No unnecessary comments

- Do **not** add comments that restate what the code does (e.g. `// loop over users` above a `for` loop).
- Prefer clear names and small functions so the code is self-explanatory.
- Comments are acceptable only when they explain **why** something is done (business rule, workaround, non-obvious constraint) or document public APIs when useful.

## Low complexity

- Avoid high cyclomatic complexity: split conditionals and loops into well-named functions.
- Prefer flat structures and early returns over deep nesting.
- If a function or component does too much or is hard to follow, break it down (SRP).
- No unnecessary abstractions or indirection — keep the code easy to read and change.
