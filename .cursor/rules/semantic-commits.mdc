# Semantic Commits

Use **semantic commit messages** with a short but **accurate description** of what was done.

- **Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`.
- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
- **Description**: One line that actually explains the change — not vague ("update stuff") but not a full essay. The reader should understand what was done without reading the diff.

Examples:

- `feat(hero): add profile photo and 8+ years badge`
- `fix(nav): close mobile menu on route change`
- `refactor(i18n): move locale strings to dedicated module`
- `chore(deps): bump Vue to 3.4`

Avoid: `fix`, `WIP`, `updates`, or descriptions that repeat the type without adding information.
